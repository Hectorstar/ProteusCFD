FILE USAGE:
base.crunch -> used to make all perturbations
moved.crunch -> always the grid that is being run
moved.bc -> bc file being used
moved.param -> param file being used
base.design -> design file being used to control the process
points.dat -> point movement routine file to feed point moving code

LIST OF DESIGN TYPES FOR base.design FILE:

0 - direct specification of point movement x-dir, must also be in points.dat
1 - direct specification of point movement y-dir, must also be in points.dat
2 - direct specification of point movement z-dir, must also be in points.dat

 The Hicks-Henne bump functions will only work in the y-direction, these
 are mostly used for airfoils anyway so that's okay for the time being

3 - Hicks-Henne bump magnitude (y-dir)
4 - Hicks-Henne max point location (y-dir)
5 - Hicks-Henne bump width (y-dir)

6 - Move whole boundary by certain deflection x-dir
7 - Move whole boundary by certain deflection y-dir
8 - Move whole boundary by certain deflection z-dir
